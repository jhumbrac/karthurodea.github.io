		<h3>The traditional resume is boring. Instead I've chosen to build this timeline of my personal and work experiences. Starting from my early days growing up in Vermont; onto my four "developmental" years in Worcester, MA; culminating in the present day. Consider these my defining moments of each epoch.</h3>

		<h2>1985 - 2002</h2>
		<img class="imgframe" src="images/Vermont.jpg" alt="Welcome to Vermont">
		<p>I grew up in Arlington, Vermont, a town with just over 2300 people.  Our claim to fame is an association with <a href="https://www.biography.com/people/norman-rockwell-37249">Norman Rockwell,</a>who lived in Arlington from 1939-1953. Between the ages of 10 and 18 I spent all my time playing soccer, basketball, and baseball. I wish I could weave together a more interesting series of events, but as the seasons changed I transitioned from one sport to the next. To wit, peruse these old newspaper clippings that were carefully stored in a shoebox in my parents' attic until a few months ago.</p>

		<img class="imgframe" src="images/Massachusetts.jpg" alt="Welcome to Massachusetts">
		<p>I left Vermont for Holy Cross College in Massachusetts, which boasts a student body of 2900, a little larger than the population of my hometown. Toward the end of high school baseball had become my primary pursuit, and I found my way <a href="http://www.goholycross.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=33100&ATCLID=210220687">onto the college baseball team as a walk-on.</a> Freshman year was lots of ups and downs, strikes and gutters; I struggled to balance coursework unlike anything I experienced in high school with the daily pain and discomfort of division I baseball (and a deep desire to learn every bar in Worcester).</p>

		<p>After two years of dormitory living and dining hall cuisine (and a <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2005/4/7/baseball-dealt-heartbreak-at-home-holy/?page=1">career-defining win at Harvard</a>) I moved off campus with 7 baseball teammates and 2 friends-of-the-program to 125 College Street, where we spent our remaining two years staving off graduation, patronizing Wendy's drive-thru, and entertaining classmates.  I love this picture because it is NOTHING like the condition of the house during my tenancy.  I couldn't find a picture of the exterior, but do your best to imagine the worst, then add ten additional degrees of worst.</p>

		<img class="imgframe" src="images/1384CommonwealthAve.png" alt="Welcome to Allston">
		<p>I graduated from Holy Cross with a degree in English, and spent the next five months living with my aunt and uncle in Chelmsford seeking employment. My first employer - <a href="https://www.edq.com/">Experian QAS</a> - tapped my formal understanding of the English language, paying me to sell mailing address validation software to local, state, and federal government agencies in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas. After a couple months of gainful employment, I moved to Allston and rented an apartment with a college roommate. I consider this a transitional moment in my history, moving from the comfort and security of living with family, to the struggle of independence, and a paycheck-to-paycheck modus operandi.</p>

		<p>Whilst employed at Experian I relocated from Allston to Charlestown, and shared an excellent two-bedroom with a new roommate (a friend of a friend).  Shortly after the reloaction I parted ways with Experian and software sales, and got my first and last taste of contract staffing at <a href="https://www.bowdoingroup.com/">Bowdoin Group</a>. I started at BG in January 2009, and left BG in January 2010.</p>

		<h2>2008 - Present</h2>
		<img class="imgframe" src="images/Cambridge.png" alt="Welcome to Cambridge">
		<p>When I left the Bowdoin Group I was concerned the last year had been a waste.  However, the time I spent cold-calling and pushing past frequent rejection became a valuable asset.  I worked my way through the interview process at <a href="https://go.forrester.com/">Forrester Research</a> and received an offer to work in their account management department.  One of the people on the interview panel at Forrester came from the staffing world, and I think my experience at the Bowdoin Group was a big driver in the decision to offer me the job.  The role was supporting two senior account directors and the ~20 enterprise clients they managed.</p>
