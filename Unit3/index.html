			<p id="slogan">A visual history of my personal and professional life</p>
			
			<p>The traditional resume is boring.  Instead, I've chosen to build this timeline of my personal and work experiences.  Starting from my early days growing up in Vermont; onto my four "developmental" years in Worcester, MA; culminating in the present day. Consider these my defining moments of each epoch.</p>

			<ul id="locations">
				<li>1985 - 2000</li>
				<li>2000 - 2010</li>
				<li>2010 - Present</li>

			<p>I grew up in Arlington, Vermont, a town with just over 2300 people.  Our claim to fame is an association with <a href="https://www.biography.com/people/norman-rockwell-37249">Norman Rockwell,</a>who lived in Arlington from 1939-1953.</p>

			<p>Between the ages of 10 and 18 I spent all my time playing soccer, basketball, and baseball.  I wish I could weave together a more interesting series of events; but the truth is as the seasons changed I went from one sport to the next ... competing - obviously - with the country's best young talent in Vermont's hotbed of youth sports.  To wit, peruse these old newspaper clippings that were carefully stored in a shoebox in my parents' attic until a few months ago.</p>

			<p>I left Vermont for Holy Cross College in Massachusetts, which boasts a student body of 2900, a little larger than the population of my hometown.  Toward the end of high school baseball had become my primary pursuit, and I found my way <a href="http://www.goholycross.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=33100&ATCLID=210220687">onto the college baseball team as a walk-on.</a></p>

			<p>After two years of dormitory living and several trips to the school's disciplinary office I moved off campus with 7 baseball teammates and 2 friends-of-the-program to 125 College Street<img src=""https://karthurodea.github.io/Unit3/images/125CollegeSt.jpg" alt="125 College St"">where we spent our remaining two years staving off graduation and entertaining classmates.</p>
